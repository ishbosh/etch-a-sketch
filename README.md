# etch-a-sketch
Odin Etch-A-Sketch Project with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal of this project is to create an Etch-A-Sketch from scratch in
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the DOM Manipulation skills learned
through The Odin Project curriculum. This should help to solidify and to
demonstrate the DOM manipulation skills that I have learned through the
course, and will also be a neat toy to play with and share.
